## Tutorial


***
To start the software, first set the game directory for "Wuthering Waves" in the settings (similar to “D:\Game\Wuthering Waves”). This is the first step.

#### About Game Playtime Statistics
As long as you start the game using this software, it will automatically track playtime for "Wuthering Waves."

#### About Card Draw Analysis
On your first use, please open the card draw history interface in the game; otherwise, the card draw data cannot be retrieved.

After setting the game directory in the settings (similar to “D:\Game\Wuthering Waves”), go to the card draw analysis interface and click "Get" to retrieve card draw information. For subsequent data retrieval for that account, simply click "Refresh."

Note: If you only need the card draw analysis feature, you can set it as the startup page in the settings.


## FAQ
### The tutorial may be partially outdated; please refer to the [WIKI](https://github.com/leck995/WutheringWavesTool/wiki) for additional guidance.
***
#### 1. Prompt indicating inability to retrieve card draw data
* Ensure the game installation root directory is correct and open the card draw history interface before retrieval.
* If you have previously modified the game configuration (e.g., unlocking frame rate), check WutheringWaves\Wuthering Waves Game\Client\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor's Engine.ini for the line global=none and remove it.
